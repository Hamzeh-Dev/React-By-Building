# Level 1 — React Fundamentals

Level 1 focuses on **building strong React fundamentals** through small, focused projects.
Each project introduces **one or two core concepts** and avoids unnecessary libraries to keep the learning pure.

This level is about **thinking in React**, not memorizing APIs.

---

## Goal of Level 1

By the end of this level, you should:

* Understand how React **state and props** work
* Know how **data flows** through components
* Be comfortable updating **arrays and objects in state**
* Understand **derived state** and why less state is better
* Know when to use **Context** and when not to

## Projects in This Level

| # | Project                 | Main Concept                          |
| - | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Counter                 | State & re-rendering                  |
| 2 | Reusable Card Component | Reusable components & props           |
| 3 | Live Input              | Controlled inputs & data flow         |
| 4 | Dynamic Render          | Loading state & conditional rendering |
| 5 | Shopping List           | State arrays (add, edit, delete)      |
| 6 | Character Counter       | Derived state vs state-driven logic   |
| 7 | Theme Switcher          | Global state with Context API         |

Each project is **independent** and has its own README.

## Concepts You Learned

### Core React

* `useState`
* Component re-rendering
* Event handling (`onClick`, `onChange`)
* Conditional rendering

### Data Flow

* Props (static & dynamic)
* Passing state down
* Passing callbacks up
* Lifting state

### State Management

* Arrays and objects in state
* Immutable updates
* Derived state (calculated values)
* Avoiding redundant state

### Side Concepts

* Basic `useEffect`
* Loading & skeleton states
* Reusable components
* Global state with Context
* Avoiding prop drilling

---

## What You Did NOT Use (Intentionally)

* Redux / Zustand
* Form libraries
* UI frameworks
* Complex abstractions

> The focus is **understanding React itself**, not the ecosystem.

---

## Recommended Self-Project (After Level 1)

Before moving to Level 2, build **one project on your own** using only Level 1 concepts:

### Suggested Idea

Build a **Notes app** where users write, read, edit, and delete notes.

Rules:

* No external state libraries
* No copying previous code
* Break UI into reusable components

If you struggle — that’s a **good sign**.
