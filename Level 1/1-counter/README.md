# 1 Counter

A simple React counter app built to **understand state** and how UI reflects it.

## Goal
Learn how React state works: updating state automatically updates the UI, components re-render predictably, and how "prev" work.

## How to Run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Hamzeh-Dev/React-By-Building.git

2. Navigate to the project:
```bash
cd .\level 1\1-counter
```

3. Install dependencies:
