# React By Building

A collection of small-to-medium React / Next.js projects designed to **learn React step by step** by building real apps.

I avoided adding extra libraries unless necessary — the goal is to understand React itself, not the ecosystem around it.

### Every project contains:

- A focused React / Next.js app

- A small README.md explaining the goal

- Only the code needed to learn the concept

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Hamzeh-Dev/React-By-Building.git
```

2. Navigate to the project you want to run:
```bash
cd 1-counter
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open in browser at http://localhost:3000

Each project is independent and can be run on its own.
