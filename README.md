# React By Building

A collection of React / Next.js projects designed to **learn React step by step** by building real apps.  

---

## Repo Idea

This repo is organized into **three levels** to help you progress from beginner to advanced React skills:  

- **Level 1 (Basics & Small Projects):** Each project focuses on **one or two core concepts**.  
- **Level 2 (Mid-Level Projects):** Projects combine multiple concepts and introduce slightly larger apps.  
- **Level 3 (Large-Level Projects):** Bigger, full-featured apps that integrate multiple React patterns, state management, and dynamic rendering.

---

## What You Have to Do

1. Start with **Level 1 projects** to build a strong foundation.  
2. Progress to **Level 2** once comfortable with basic state, props, and component patterns.  
3. Finish **Level 3** for hands-on experience with large-scale React apps.  
4. After each level, try a **self-project** to apply what you’ve learned.

---

## Where to Start

- Begin in the **Level 1 folder** (`1-counter`, `2-resuable-card-component`, etc.)  
- Each project has its own folder and README explaining the goal and steps.  
- Run projects independently, no dependencies between them.

---

## What You Will Learn in Each Level

### **Level 1 – Basics & Small Projects**
- React state and `useState`
- Passing props and dynamic props
- Handling user input
- Conditional rendering
- Rendering lists
- `useEffect` basics for side effects
- Dynamic rendering / loading states

**Recommendation self-project after Level 1:**  
Build a **Notes app** where users write, read, edit, and delete notes.

---

### **Level 2 – Mid-Level Projects**
- Reusable and nested components
- Component composition
- Advanced state management with `useReducer`
- API fetching and error handling
- Skeleton loading & dynamic lists
- Lifting state up for shared state

**Recommendation self-project after Level 2:**  
Create a **mini dashboard** for users or tasks, combining fetching data, filtering, and reusable cards.

---

### **Level 3 – Large-Level Projects**
- Full-featured apps with multiple pages
- Complex component hierarchies
- Form validation
- Dynamic routing (Next.js)
- Combining multiple hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, `useRef`)
- Optimizing performance with React best practices

**Recommendation self-project after Level 3:**  
Build a **personal portfolio / social app** that integrates all concepts: forms, API data, dynamic rendering, reusable components, and state management.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

**Via SSH:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Hamzeh-Dev/React-By-Building.git
```

**Via HTTPS::**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamzeh-Dev/React-By-Building.git
```

2. Navigate to the project you want to run:

```bash
cd '.\Level 1\1-counter'
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open in browser at http://localhost:3000


> I avoided adding extra libraries unless necessary — the focus is to **understand React itself**, not the ecosystem around it.
> Each project is independent and can be run on its own.

## How to Use

Follow the project READMEs in each folder.

Experiment with the code, change values, add features.

After completing each level, try the recommended self-project to solidify your skills.
