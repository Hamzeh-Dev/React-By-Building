# 1 Tabs

A reusable Tabs component built to **learn compound components and internal context**.
This project shifts your mindset from:

> “How do I make this work?”
> to
> “How should this component be designed?”

It uses a single file with a clean API, without any global state.

## Goal

* Learn how to design reusable compound components
* Understand how to share state between related components internally
* Practice clean component API design with minimal props drilling
* Learn how to structure React components for scalability

**Note:** There’s a small challenge in the `Container.tsx` file for you to implement.
